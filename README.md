# N-gram Predictive Text

Predictive text engine for LIGN 6 final project built using N-Gram.

## Proposal

Project proposal is visible [here](PROPOSAL.md).

## Results


### Our Task

Our project is an N-Gram predictive text engine, similar to what cell phones use for autocomplete.
We wanted to not only implement the basic functionality of "predict the next word," but we also
wanted it to adapt as the user is typing input.

### Tools Used

We used Python with NLTK for the N-Grams. All the N-Gram models are stored using pure python dicts
and arrays.
To allow dynamic input, we built a basic webapp using http.server and jquery.

### How We Installed It

We didn't install it, we built it! But to run it yourself run `python server.py` and open `index.html`
in your browser. If you want to try the command line app, run `python main.py`.
